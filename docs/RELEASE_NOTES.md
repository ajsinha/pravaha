## 0.1.0 — QA, 2026-09-20

**What this build is for.** Quality assurance on a single node. It is the first cut offered to
anyone but its author, and the point of it is to be tried, not to be deployed: run a node, register
continuous queries, watch answers change, break it, and tell the author what broke.

**Nothing has been published from this tree.** No Maven repository, no container registry, no
Python index, no signing key. A QA reader builds it, or is handed the artefacts the release script
produced. The licence is proprietary ([`../LICENSE`](../LICENSE)) and every file in the tree says so.

### What it does

A SQL query registered once keeps answering. Rows arrive from a source, the answer is maintained
incrementally as a Z-set — a change carries a weight, `+1` for an insert and `-1` for a retraction —
and the current answer is a view that can be read, subscribed to, or written to a sink.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Ask it** | Flight SQL, a REST API (`/api/v1`), the PostgreSQL wire protocol, `pravaha` on the command line, a Java SDK, a Python SDK, and the console in a browser |
| **Sources** | Filesystem (bounded or followed), feedfile directories (CSV, Parquet), Delta Lake, JDBC polling, Aerospike scans, Cassandra `token()`-range scans, PostgreSQL change data capture, Kafka topics (JSON, Avro and Protobuf — with no Avro or Confluent library) |
| **Sinks** | `filesystem`, `aerospike-sink`, `jdbc-sink`, `kafka-sink`, `delta-sink`. Five, and each states its delivery guarantee at registration rather than in a document |
| **Survives a restart** | Checkpoints, a registry journal, and sinks that stage a checkpoint and commit it once the checkpoint is durable |
| **Explains itself** | Every refusal is a `PRV-nnnn` code with a sentence saying what to do; `EXPLAIN` shows the plan; a query's plan carries per-operator rows in, rows out and a measured bottleneck; a debug session forks a query from a checkpoint and steps it row by row |

### The numbers, and the commands that produce them

| Measurement | Result | Command |
|---|---|---|
| Java tests | **4,067 run, 0 failures, 183 skipped**, 37 reactor projects | `tools/verify-clean.sh` (offline, wipes the project from `~/.m2` first) |
| Console tests | **844 run, 842 passed** at the last full run; the two failures were a test-isolation defect and a load flake, both since fixed | `cd console && python -m pytest` |
| Python SDK tests | **132 collected, 131 passed, 1 skipped** without the `tls-keystore` extra | `cd sdk/python && python -m pytest` |
| Skips | 184, and every one of them names its reason: Docker, Cassandra, Aerospike or `psql` absent on the machine | in the surefire output |

The skips matter for QA: a machine without Docker does not run the Kafka broker, PostgreSQL CDC or
Aerospike integration tests, and they are skipped **by name** rather than passing quietly.

### Performance, measured here and nowhere else

There is no reference hardware, so the gates were measured on the development machine — an AMD
Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, 12 physical cores, frequency-scaled, with other work running — and every number
in [`gates/measured-2026-09-20/`](gates/measured-2026-09-20) carries the machine's load average
beside it.

| Gate | Target | Measured | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| P2, Profile A throughput | ≥ 1.2 M rows/s per lane | ~30 M warm, ~11 M cold; the worst pass, at load 77, was 1.04 M | **reached** |
| P2, scaling 1 → 8 lanes | ≥ 90 % of linear | **28–42 %** | **not reached** |
| P3, Profile B throughput | ≥ 350 k rows/s per lane | 2.5–2.8 M, worst pass 1.1 M | **reached**, and measured for the first time |
| ADR-038's Nexmark comparison | head-to-head against Flink | **not run** — no Flink, no quiet machine, no reference generator. Of Nexmark's 23 queries, **5 run** on this engine today | **not reached** |

A QA reader should not quote the throughput figures as product numbers. They were taken on a laptop
part under load, several are too noisy to state as a figure, and the harness says so where they are.

### Known, and deliberately not in this build

- **Multi-node execution.** Designed ([ADR-045](adr/045-cluster-mode-assigns-queries-not-rows.md))
  and on hold by the owner's decision. A node refuses `PARTITIONED` with `PRV-9002` rather than
  serving every partition while claiming to own some.
- **Continuous integration.** Four workflows exist; **none has ever run**. Nothing is built, tested,
  published or signed by a machine other than this one.
- **Tenancy and admission quotas.**
- **The manual WCAG 2.2 AA audit.** The automated half — axe on every page, both themes, both
  densities — is green; a person still has to do the rest.
- **The console's design-system surface**, by decision.
- Smaller refusals, each named and reasoned where it is raised: no secondary index over a non-key
  column, no `INSERT INTO <sink> SELECT`, no Iceberg or Hudi sink, no partitioned Delta tables,
  `COUNT(DISTINCT)` cannot spill.

### Open defects

The register is [`qa/FINDINGS.md`](qa/FINDINGS.md), and it is the honest list: every defect found,
what happened to it, and what is still true of the build.

At this cut: **369 findings — 335 fixed, 20 open, 0 GA-BLOCKER, 0 GA-REQUIRED**, 15 of the open ones
triaged POST-GA and 2 recorded as notes rather than defects. The header's counts are enforced by
`FindingsRegisterTest`, so this page and the register cannot drift apart silently.

Three worth a QA reader's attention before they start:

- **SPILL-3** — firing a very large window builds it on the heap and can exhaust it, whether or not
  the spill tier is on. Bounded by the operator's own sizing; `OPERATIONS.md` gives the arithmetic.
- **PF-12** — a benchmark harness reported 131 % of linear scaling on a loaded machine and *passed*.
  Fixed, and recorded because it is the first defect here that produced a pass rather than a
  failure. If a number looks too good on a busy machine, distrust it.
- **SRC-7** — an Aerospike `lut-scan` buffers a whole scan on the heap, and `maxRecords` bounds
  only what it hands on. Size the heap for the scan, or use `deletes: detect` with a narrower
  range.

### Running it

[`QUICKSTART.md`](QUICKSTART.md) is the five-minute path, and its `application.yaml` declares an
event-time column — which it did not until today, so a first-time reader's windowed query silently
never emitted. [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md) covers the container image and the Helm chart, both
of which run one node by design. [`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) carries the code index.
