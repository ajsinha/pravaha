# QA findings — every defect, and what happened to it

254 test cases, 254 executed, **75 FAIL**. This is the whole list, so that nothing is closed by
being forgotten. Status is one of:

| | |
|---|---|
| **FIXED** | Changed, and the fix verified by re-running the case that found it. |
| **PARTIAL** | The reported symptom is closed; the underlying cause is not. Says what remains. |
| **OPEN** | Not addressed. Still true of the build. |

**Round 1 remediation closed 16 of 75.** They were chosen by severity — wrong answers, silent data
loss, and data exposure first — not by area, which is why the documentation block below is
untouched and why the count is what it is.

## Ingestion — 13 findings, 2 fixed

| # | Sev | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| I-1 | BLOCKER | `ServedView`'s maps raced between the lane, the feed's commit timer and readers. Feed thread died of `ConcurrentModificationException` after 181,248 of 200,000 rows — silently, query still `RUNNING`. | **FIXED** — maps guarded by the view's monitor; regression test keys on a unique column and runs a concurrent reader |
| I-2 | BLOCKER | One malformed line ends ingestion for the whole query and loses the rows before it. `FilesystemPartitionReader.poll` documents a dead-letter queue and rethrows. | **OPEN** |
| I-3 | HIGH | `DelegatingRowWriter.abort()` throws `UnsupportedOperationException`, destroying the decode diagnostic that was already computed. | **OPEN** |
| I-4 | HIGH | Nothing validates `pravaha.streams.<n>.schema` against the source binding's own `schema`. Every mismatch is caught at the first row as a dead feed, never at config time. | **OPEN** |
| I-5 | HIGH | A second registration of identical SQL returned `RUNNING` under a name no view answered to. | **FIXED** — the shared path now registers the view alias and journals the name |
| I-6 | HIGH | `SourceFeed.describe()` reaches no shipped surface. A dead feed, an unbound stream and a quiet source are indistinguishable in `pravaha queries`. | **OPEN** — the feed now *records* failure; nothing surfaces it |
| I-7 | MED | Only `filesystem` is on the server classpath; `feedfile`/`jdbc`/`delta` are not, and `JarLauncher` offers no "drop a jar in" mechanism. Documentation says otherwise. | **OPEN** |
| I-8 | MED | A directory as `path` passes `open()` and fails at the first read, naming neither path nor cause. | **OPEN** |
| I-9 | LOW | `/api/v1/status` reports the stream count in `registeredQueries`; `plugins` always `[]`. | **OPEN** |
| I-10 | LOW | Pausing one name of a shared computation silently pauses the others. | **OPEN** |
| I-11 | LOW | No startup warning for a binding whose plugin, path or stream cannot be resolved. | **OPEN** |
| I-12 | LOW | A reserved word is accepted as a stream name. | **OPEN** |
| I-13 | — | Backpressure was untestable, because every large-source case died of I-1 within a batch. | **Re-testable now** — I-1 was the blocker |

## Security — 9 findings, 6 fixed, 1 partial

| # | Sev | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| S-1 | CRITICAL | Flight TLS never worked: `netty-transport-native-unix-common` absent, so the node logged `transport=TLS`, bound its port and answered nobody. Failure mode is a fleet authenticated over plaintext. | **FIXED** — dependency added; verified with a real handshake |
| S-2 | CRITICAL | `policy=authenticated` could never start a node: `hosting()` ran `requireOnePolicy()` against the constructor's `PERMISSIVE` default. | **FIXED** — `authorizedBy` before `hosting`; my own test had passed only because it ran with Flight disabled |
| S-3 | CRITICAL | Flight `DROP`/`PAUSE`/`RESUME` authorized nothing. An unauthenticated caller dropped every query on a node serving only verified callers. Dropping destroys accumulated state. | **FIXED** — `mayAdminister`, defaulting to `mayRead` |
| S-4 | CRITICAL | Flight `LIST` was unauthorized and returned full SQL text, including values `application.yaml` says to permission like data. | **FIXED** — filtered by `mayRead`, so a principal does not learn the rest exists |
| S-5 | HIGH | The same `LIST` gap reachable with no credential at all. | **FIXED** — same change |
| S-6 | HIGH | Read-time authorization sees only the view name. A principal who may register can launder a restricted stream into an allowed name and read it. | **OPEN** — needs lineage in `mayRead`; the most important item left |
| S-7 | HIGH | No HTTP controller consults the principal or the policy. | **PARTIAL** — the contradictory config (`policy=authenticated` + `authentication=none`) is now refused at startup, which closes the demonstrated hole. A custom policy denying a specific principal is still not consulted over HTTP |
| S-8 | MED | The 401 body was `{code, message, status}` rather than the `ApiError` shape. | **FIXED** |
| S-9 | — | Concurrency around authorization (revocation during an open subscription, `drop` racing `register`) never tested. | **OPEN — never tested** |

## SQL correctness — 15 findings, 5 fixed

| # | Sev | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-1 | BLOCKER | Windowed aggregation emitted nothing, ever, silently. Four defects in series: the node never enabled watermarks; nothing could declare an event-time column; the plugin stamped every row with event time zero; Arrow cast a zoned timestamp to the unzoned vector. | **FIXED** — all four; verified with hand-checked sums |
| Q-2 | HIGH | Every aggregate over a floating-point column: 0 rows under a green status on the streaming path, raw internal error over a view. | **FIXED as a refusal** — the accumulators still have no double path; refused rather than answered, as DECIMAL is |
| Q-3 | HIGH | `COUNT(col)` counted nulls — it was `COUNT(*)`. | **FIXED** in `GlobalAggregate`; **keyed and windowed paths not yet checked** |
| Q-4 | HIGH | `ROUND` was banker's rounding: `ROUND(2.5)=2`, disagreeing with Calcite, Postgres, MySQL, Oracle. | **FIXED** — half away from zero |
| Q-5 | HIGH | Integer division by zero hangs five minutes, loses the whole batch, and swallows the `ArithmeticException`. | **OPEN** |
| Q-6 | HIGH | `COUNT(DISTINCT)`, documented ✅, hangs five minutes over a stream and is refused over a view. | **OPEN** |
| Q-7 | HIGH | Overflow drops the row silently under a success status, or hangs five minutes — non-deterministically, same command, same input. | **OPEN** |
| Q-8 | HIGH | `SqlSupportMatrixTest` never runs a row or compares a value, so none of Q-2..Q-7 would fail the build — while `SQL_SUPPORT.md` opens by claiming every construct is checked by a test. | **OPEN** |
| Q-9 | MED | Any `--sql` value starting with `--` is silently replaced by the string `true` and planned as that. | **OPEN** |
| Q-10 | MED | `--out-schema` is not checked against the plan's real output type; `-7 % 3` wrote `4294967295` under a success status. | **OPEN** |
| Q-11 | MED | `SELECT -n` is refused, and the refusal claims unary minus is supported. | **OPEN** |
| Q-12 | MED | `ABS(Long.MIN_VALUE)` returned a negative absolute value. | **FIXED** — throws |
| Q-13 | MED | `PRV-2003` documented and never emitted; "Known streams" lists views and omits every configured base stream. | **OPEN** |
| Q-14 | LOW | A deeply nested predicate refuses as the literal text `PRV-2001  null`. | **OPEN** |
| Q-15 | — | Lookup join is programmatic-only: a documented ✅ unreachable from a configured node. | **OPEN** |

## Deployment and recovery — 10 findings, 3 fixed

| # | Sev | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-1 | HIGH | Checkpoints are written and never read. `CheckpointStore.latest()` and `QueryExecution.restore()` are called from nowhere; every checkpoint file is 60 bytes with an empty operator state. `application.yaml` claims a restart recovers answers. | **OPEN** — and the claim is still in the file |
| D-2 | HIGH | No `HealthIndicator` exists. A node unreachable by any client reports `UP`/`UP`/`UP`. | **OPEN** |
| D-3 | HIGH | A second name for a shared computation was never journalled: acknowledged, absent after restart, node logs "recovered 2 of 2". | **FIXED** |
| D-4 | HIGH | A journal append failure refused the registration to the client and left the query registered, running and serving. | **FIXED** — unwinds |
| D-5 | MED-HIGH | `/actuator/prometheus` returns 404; the registry dependency is absent while `application.yaml` exposes the endpoint. | **OPEN** |
| D-6 | MED | A query named `..` wrote checkpoints above the configured root, and `SensitiveFiles` chmodded that parent to 700. | **FIXED** — dots stripped |
| D-7 | MED | Checkpoint failures are silent: the registry passes a no-op logger. | **OPEN** |
| D-8 | LOW | Both launchers break through a symlink. | **OPEN** |
| D-9 | LOW | `RegistryJournal.compact()` is called only from its own test; the journal grows for the life of the deployment. | **OPEN** |
| D-10 | LOW | Dropped queries leave their checkpoint directories behind. | **OPEN** |

Also fixed in this round, found by me rather than reported: a dropped view kept answering for ever
(`ViewCatalog` had no removal at all), and two pre-existing test races.

## Documentation — 28 findings, 0 fixed

**None of these were addressed in round 1.** They are held deliberately until the documentation
re-QA pass reports, because editing the documents underneath the agent verifying them would waste
its pass and produce a report about a state that no longer exists. They are not closed and not
dismissed.

The four that matter most, all of which mislead a new reader within their first ten minutes:

| # | Sev | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| C-1 | CRITICAL | `README.md`'s evaluation banner says the server has **no ingestion path at all** and that a registered query never receives a row. It is the first screen an evaluator reads, and it describes the product's central capability as absent. `OPERATIONS.md:298` repeats it. | **OPEN** |
| C-2 | CRITICAL | QUICKSTART step 2 — the first command a user types — does not run (`--out-schema is required`), and its `--schema` declares 2 columns for a 4-column CSV. | **OPEN** |
| C-3 | CRITICAL | QUICKSTART step 3 fails identically, so the reader never sees the `PRV-2050` lesson the step exists to teach. | **OPEN** |
| C-4 | CRITICAL | `HANDOVER.md` claims every QUICKSTART command is executed by `ExamplesTest` and so cannot rot. `ExamplesTest` never opens QUICKSTART.md — which is why C-2 and C-3 exist. | **OPEN** |

The remaining 24 are listed in `logs/DOC.md` with evidence: the inert-then-live `pravaha.watermark`
block, `SECURITY.md` documenting zero `pravaha.security.*` keys, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` missing ten
real error codes while claiming completeness, metrics documented three contradictory ways, a
`pravaha.flight.port: 8815` that contradicts every other file, an onboarding walk that fails twice
inside this week's rewrite, and `docs.pravaha.io` being NXDOMAIN while a test asserts on the URL.

Two non-documentation bugs the documentation agent found on the way, both **OPEN**:
`ErrorCode.category()` throws for 8xxx and 9xxx codes from inside `ApiExceptionHandler`; and three
documents tell operators to prune checkpoints by hand when `PeriodicCheckpointer` already does it.
