## Decision

Calcite as compiler, custom runtime

## Alternatives considered

Calcite `Enumerable` execution; Flink embedding; hand-written parser

## Rationale and consequences

Enumerable cannot meet the NFRs; Flink violates the embeddable/lightweight premise; a hand-written parser throws away Calcite's optimizer (§11, G1)

## Notes

This ADR is the durable record of a decision summarised in the system design's ADR table
(§33). Where the two differ, this file is authoritative for the reasoning and the design
document is authoritative for how the decision is applied.

ADRs are amended, never rewritten. If this decision is superseded, the file keeps its number
and gains a `Superseded by ADR-NNN` line at the top rather than being deleted -- the reasoning
behind a decision that was later reversed is usually the most useful thing in the directory.
