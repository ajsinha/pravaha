# What SQL Pravaha runs

Every construct below is **checked by a test**, not by someone's memory:
[`SqlSupportMatrixTest`](../pravaha-sql/src/test/java/com/ash/messaging/pravaha/sql/plan/SqlSupportMatrixTest.java)
runs each statement in this page against the real planner. If a construct starts working, or stops,
the build fails and names this file. That is the only way a page like this stays true.

## Continuous queries and view reads run the same SQL

There is one planner and one set of operators. A continuous query registered against a source and a
request/response query against a maintained view both go through `SqlPlanner` → `PhysicalPlanBuilder`
→ the same physical operators, so **everything on this page applies to both**. That is deliberate:
two implementations of `WHERE` agree until the day they do not, and that day is a support call about
a number.

The one asymmetry worth knowing is the unwindowed keyed `GROUP BY`. For a continuous query it is
refused **and should be** — over an endless stream its state never stops growing. For a bounded read
of a view the same argument does not hold, because the scan ends, so the same SQL is a reasonable
question there and is refused only because the operator to run it does not exist yet. Both are
covered [below](#should-a-continuous-query-aggregate-at-all).

## The short version

Pravaha runs **the shape of query people actually write against a stream**: pick columns, filter
them, join on a key, aggregate over a window. It deliberately does not try to be a general analytics
engine — ADR-030 puts ad-hoc federated analytics explicitly out of scope, and every refusal below is
a case of that decision rather than an unfinished corner.

**A query Pravaha cannot run is refused when it is planned, with a `PRV-` code and an explanation.**
It is never accepted and then approximated. That matters more than the size of the supported set: a
refusal costs a developer five minutes, and a query that runs and returns a plausible wrong number
costs whatever was decided on the strength of it.

## Projection — `SELECT`

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| `SELECT a, b`, `SELECT *`, `AS` aliases | ✅ | |
| Integer and floating arithmetic — `amount * 2 + 1`, `price / 2` | ✅ | |
| `CAST(x AS DOUBLE)` | ✅ | Between numeric types |
| Literals — `SELECT 1` | ✅ | |
| `CASE WHEN … THEN … END` | ❌ | `PRV-2021` |
| Scalar functions — `ABS`, `ROUND`, `FLOOR` | ❌ | `PRV-2021` |
| String functions — `UPPER`, `SUBSTRING` | ❌ | `PRV-2021` |
| String concatenation — `a \|\| b` | ❌ | `PRV-2021` |
| `SELECT DISTINCT` | ❌ | `PRV-2050` — it is a `GROUP BY` over an unbounded key space; see below |

The expression compiler evaluates to a number. Text is carried through a projection unchanged but
never computed with, which is why `UPPER` and `||` are refused rather than half-working.

## Filtering — `WHERE` and `HAVING`

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| `=`, `<>`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` | ✅ | |
| `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` | ✅ | `NOT` is pushed down at compile time by De Morgan |
| `IN (a, b, c)` | ✅ | Expanded to a chain of equalities |
| `BETWEEN a AND b` | ✅ | Expanded to `>= AND <=` |
| `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL` | ✅ | |
| Arithmetic in a predicate — `amount * 2 > 100` | ✅ | |
| A bare boolean column — `WHERE flagged` | ✅ | |
| Column against column — `WHERE a > b` | ✅ | Both numeric |
| `HAVING` | ✅ | A filter above the aggregate |
| `LIKE` | ❌ | `PRV-2021` |
| Text ordering — `WHERE status > user_id` | ❌ | `PRV-2021`. `>` on text needs a collation, and assuming one gives wrong answers that look right. `=` and `<>` on text do work |
| Comparing text to a number | ❌ | `PRV-2021` |

Three-valued logic is honoured throughout: a comparison with NULL is UNKNOWN, and a filter keeps
only rows where the predicate is TRUE.

## Aggregation

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| Global `COUNT(*)` | ✅ | One group, so bounded |
| `TUMBLE` windows | ✅ | |
| `HOP` (sliding) windows | ✅ | |
| `COUNT`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG` | ✅ | |
| `COUNT(DISTINCT x)` | ✅ | |
| Aggregate over an expression — `SUM(amount * 2)` | ✅ | |
| `HAVING` on an aggregate | ✅ | |
| `GROUP BY key` **without** a window | ❌ | `PRV-2050` |
| `SESSION` windows | ❌ | `PRV-2020` — implemented in the runtime, no SQL surface yet |

### Should a continuous query aggregate at all?

Yes — **windowed aggregation is the point of the engine**, not a feature bolted onto it. A continuous
query that only filters and projects is a `grep` with extra steps, and nobody needs incremental
computation for that. The value is in maintaining `SUM`, `COUNT` and `COUNT(DISTINCT)` over a window
and keeping them correct as data arrives, late data included. The query on the front of the README is
exactly that shape, and it is what the Z-set algebra in §4 exists to make incremental.

So the answer splits, and the split is not a compromise:

- **Windowed `GROUP BY` — yes.** Supported, incremental, with bounded state and late-data correction.
  This is the primary use.
- **Unwindowed keyed `GROUP BY` — no, and it should stay that way.** Over a stream with no end, its
  state grows with the number of distinct keys and never shrinks. There is no configuration that
  fixes it and no machine large enough to outrun it.

### Why an unwindowed `GROUP BY` is refused

`SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) FROM txn GROUP BY user_id` is refused, and this surprises people, so it is
worth being clear that it is a decision and not a gap.

A stream has no end. That aggregate has to keep one entry per distinct `user_id` **forever**, so its
memory is a function of how many users ever appear — not of anything the operator configured. It
does not fail on the day it is deployed. It fails months later, in production, and the query looks
innocent in the review that approved it.

Adding a window makes the state bounded, because a window closes:

```sql
SELECT window_start, window_end, user_id, COUNT(*)
FROM TABLE(TUMBLE(TABLE txn, DESCRIPTOR(event_time), INTERVAL '10' SECOND))
GROUP BY window_start, window_end, user_id
```

Grouping by a windowed stream *without* putting `window_start` and `window_end` in the `GROUP BY` is
refused too — that is the unbounded case wearing a window's clothes.

**And over a bounded read of a view?** `SELECT tier, COUNT(*) FROM user_volume GROUP BY tier` is a
perfectly reasonable question — the scan ends, so nothing grows without bound — and it is refused
today anyway. The memory argument does not apply; the honest reason is that **there is no keyed
unwindowed aggregate operator**. `AggregateOperator` is executed by `GlobalAggregate`, which
aggregates everything into a single group. Allowing the plan through without writing that operator
would return one row where the query asked for one per key: a wrong answer that looks entirely
plausible, which is worse than any refusal.

This is a real gap and a likely next piece of work, since it is what a dashboard over a view wants.
`GlobalAggregate` throws if it is ever handed a keyed operator, so whoever relaxes the planner check
without writing the operator first gets a loud failure rather than quietly halved numbers.

## Joins

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| `INNER JOIN` on an equality | ✅ | Symmetric hash join, incremental both ways |
| Multi-column equi-join | ✅ | `ON a.x = b.x AND a.y = b.y` |
| Three-way and deeper | ✅ | |
| Self join | ✅ | |
| Lookup join against a dimension table | ✅ | Async, on virtual threads, ordered output |
| `LEFT` / `RIGHT` / `FULL OUTER` | ❌ | `PRV-2020` |
| `CROSS JOIN` | ❌ | `PRV-2020` |
| Non-equi join — `ON a.x > b.x` | ❌ | `PRV-2020` |

An outer join between streams has to hold every unmatched row indefinitely, in case its partner
arrives later — the same unbounded-state problem as an unwindowed `GROUP BY`, which is why it is
refused rather than shipped and hoped for. A cross join has no key to partition on, so it cannot be
made incremental at all.

**In practice this covers the joins people write.** A stream joined to another stream on a key, and a
stream enriched from a dimension table, are the two shapes that make up nearly all of it.

## Sorting, sets and subqueries

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| Derived tables — `FROM (SELECT …) x` | ✅ | |
| `WITH` (common table expressions) | ✅ | |
| `SELECT STREAM` | ✅ | Accepted as a synonym; every query here is a streaming query |
| `ORDER BY` | ❌ | `PRV-2020` |
| `LIMIT` / `OFFSET` | ❌ | `PRV-2020` |
| `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT` | ❌ | `PRV-2020` |
| `IN (subquery)`, `EXISTS`, scalar subqueries | ❌ | `PRV-2021` |
| Window functions — `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (…)` | ❌ | `PRV-2021` |
| `VALUES` | ❌ | `PRV-2020` |
| `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` | ❌ | `PRV-2020` — Pravaha answers questions; sinks write results |

Note what `ORDER BY` means over a stream: a total order over rows that have not all arrived. It is
meaningful over a *bounded* read of a maintained view, and that is where it would land if it is
added — not over a continuous query.

## Parameters

`?` placeholders are supported in `WHERE` and `HAVING`, and nowhere else. See
[ADR-032](adr/032-parameters-are-values-not-queries.md) for the full position table and the reasoning.

```java
client.query("SELECT total FROM user_volume WHERE user_id = ?", "u1");
```
```python
client.query("SELECT total FROM user_volume WHERE user_id = ?", ["u1"])
```

## Types

Supported on the wire and in expressions: `BOOLEAN`, `TINYINT`, `SMALLINT`, `INTEGER`, `BIGINT`,
`REAL`, `DOUBLE`, `VARCHAR`, `VARBINARY`, `DATE`, `TIME`, `TIMESTAMP`.

`DECIMAL` is refused rather than sent as a floating-point number, because the rounding decision
belongs to whoever owns the ledger and not to a serialiser. Year–month intervals (`INTERVAL '1'
MONTH`) are refused because a month is not a fixed length of time; day–time intervals work and are
what windows use.

## What to do when something here is refused

1. **Read the message.** Every `PRV-` refusal says what is unsupported and, where there is one, what
   to write instead.
2. **If it is an unbounded-state refusal (`PRV-2050`), add a window.** That is almost always the
   right answer, and it is usually what was meant.
3. **If the work is genuinely not streaming** — a total order, a set difference, an ad-hoc join
   across two stores — that is what ADR-030 tier 4 puts out of scope on purpose. Pravaha maintains
   the answer to a question asked in advance; a query engine answers questions asked just now, and
   trying to be both is how a system becomes bad at each.
